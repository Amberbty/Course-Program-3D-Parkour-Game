## Description
This is a 3D parkour game in which the user controls the character in the first-person view. The goal of the game is to run as far as possible.

## Manipulation
The player moves left and right and jumps to avoid obstacles. There are 3 kinds of obstacles, each with different heights and widths.

## UI
- **Distance** and **Score** are recorded in the upper left corner of the game interface.
- Distance is calculated in proportion to the distance run by the player.
- One point is scored for each obstacle crossed.

## FX
- **VFX**: Animation when the player jumps and hits obstacles.
- **SFX**: Sound effects include running footsteps, jumping, landing, and bumping sounds.
- **Particle System**: Dirt effect when the user is running, smoke effect when the user hits an obstacle.
- **PowerUp**: A ring is spawned on the ground every 10 seconds starting 2 seconds after the game begins. If the user hits the ring, they can jump higher.
